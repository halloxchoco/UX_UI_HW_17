            <p>My name is Britt Cassidy and my pronouns are they/them.

                I know that design is an incredible tool that lets us foster real human connection, and I specialize in bringing that to my work. My skills include Adobe XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, creating dazzling user-focused prototypes, and playing well with others.
                
                In my free time I enjoy creative writing, play games of all sorts (my favorites are DND and Animal Crossing) and consuming video essays on YouTube on a range of topics. I love learning new things all the time.</p>
